# JurySimulator
 A simple python program that generates one of the possible assessments for a 3rd year jazz course at MacEwan University

# To run this program
This program was written in python 3 so some python interpreter will need to be installed on your system. I used Anaconda.

This program runs within the console, on unix (which has python3 natively) this would look like

 ```
  python3 /your-path/Run.py
 ```
 
 This will launch the program and wait for user input, you can type in "all" to get every possible assessment
 or any integer n >= 0 to get n possible assessments.
 
 At any time you can type "exit" to stop the program.
